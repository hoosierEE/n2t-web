** What we'll study (theory)
- Boolean algebra
- number representation (decimal, binary)
- two's complement arithmetic
- coding languages: HDL, Hack, Python3
- test-driven design

** What we'll study (practice)
- convert numbers: binary \leftrightarrow decimal
- build a functional computer in a simulator
- use a hardware description language
- use an assembly language
- write an assembler in Python

** Materials
- slides and video
- textbook (free pdf)
- Canvas pages
- supplemental files (sometimes)

* Resources
#+REVEAL: split
- Canvas
- Autograder

** Canvas
For /quizzes/ and /exams/

also:
- syllabus
- due dates
- announcements
- assignment info
- grades

** Autograder
To turn in /homework projects/.

NOTE: The autograder is *much slower* than your computer, so I recommend running tests locally and using the autograder for ...grading.

* Software
Recommended: download and run on your personal computer

/(...or, if that does not work, use Luddy machines.)/
** Nand2Tetris
1. install [[https://java.com/en/download/][Java]] (if necessary)
2. download [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xZzcMIUETv3u3sdpM_oTJSTetpVee3KZ][nand2tetris zip file]]
3. extract zip and run the *HardwareSimulator* (DEMO)

** Python3
- [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][python web site]] (small download), or
- [[https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution][anaconda]] (large download)

anaconda is optional, but good

** Text Editor
NOTE: ~"quotes"~ good, "smart quotes" bad

Otherwise take your pick:
- popular and modern: [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][Visual Studio Code]]
- ancient but capable: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] or [[https://www.vim.org/][vim]]
- basic: [[https://alexshroyer.com/hdl][hdl online]]
