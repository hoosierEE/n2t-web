2 to the power:
 6  5  4 3 2 1 0
64 32 16 8 4 2 1  powers of 2
multiplied by each digit:
 1 0  1 1 0 1 0
sum results:
64+0+16+8+0+2+0 = 90

Algorithm:
Biggest power of two which is <= 523? 512 (2^9)
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  (indexes)
1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  (512)
523-512 = 11
Biggest power of two <= 11? 8 (2^3)

11-8 = 3
Biggest power of two <= 3? 2 (2^1)
