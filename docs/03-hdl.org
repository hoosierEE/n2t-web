Hardware Description Language (HDL)
* HDL is a computer language
- syntax
- semantics
- used by a Hardware Simulator
* HDL describes hardware connections
- A connects to B
- B connects to C
- C is an input to D
- etc.
* HardwareSimulator:
- connects components
- provides inputs
- and displays outputs
* Predefined Parts
~Nand~ is predefined. You build other parts from Nand, then you can use those new parts to build more complex parts, and on and on.
| x | y | Nand |
|---+---+------|
| 0 | 0 |    1 |
| 0 | 1 |    1 |
| 1 | 0 |    1 |
| 1 | 1 |    0 |
* Example
a Xor b = (a Nand (a Nand b)) Nand (b Nand (a Nand b))
* HDL implementation
#+begin_src nand2tetris
CHIP Xor {
    IN a,b;
    OUT out;
    PARTS:
        Nand(a=a, b=b, out=wire1);
        Nand(a=a, b=wire1, out=wa);
        Nand(a=b, b=wire1, out=wb);
        Nand(a=wa, b=wb, out=out);
}
